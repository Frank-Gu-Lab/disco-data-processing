# disco-data-processing
This repository contains the code under development by the Frank Gu Lab for DISCO-NMR data processing.
The purpose of this repository is to create a centralized location for lab members to: develop code for DISCO-NMR data processing, request additional features for the code, track bugs, and provide version control.

If you have a feature you would like to request, or have observed a bug in the code, please submit your comments through an "Issue" under the Issues tab.  

For instructions on setting up the code for execution, please see the Jupyter Notebook.
